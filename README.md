Glitched Worlds SMB2J Patch
===========================

This patch adds a world select menu when starting SMB2J.

Make sure to only choose files 0, 1, 2 or 3, any other files will likely just crash the game.. But that's half the fun.

Usage:
 - Press select to switch between lines
 - Press Left or Right to change values by 1, Up or Down to change by 16
 - Press B to save your selections to disk
 - Press Start to start the game!
 - Press Start+A to start the game with the hard mode flag set (doesn't do much except change how the level name is displayed on the title screen.)

The 'file' behavior is a little weird, so if you want to match the original game:
 - If you want to play 1-1, select File 0 and pick World 0
 - If you want to play 5-1, select File 1 and pick World 4
 - If you want to play 9-1, select File 2 and pick World 8
 - If you want to play A-1, select File 3 and pick World 0

A couple of extra things to be aware of:
 - The selectors are 0-based, so if you pick world 0, area 0, you will get what's normally 1-1 (the title screen will show 1-1.) This was done to make it easier to remember level numbers rather than having to remember that you were on "right side of a cloud - copyright sign"
 
 - The 'area' selector picks areas not levels. If you play a stage where there's a pipe entry cutscene, it is it's own separate area. This way you can access every single area but the numbering can be a little off.


Download & Installation
=======================

First, download the latest patch from the [releases](https://github.com/threecreepio/smb2j-glitchedworlds/releases)

Then simply apply that IPS (using for instance Lunar IPS) to the original, unmodified version of the "Super Mario Brothers 2 (Japan).fds" ROM. 

The MD5 checksum for the ROM you should be using is `7f38210a8a2befb8d347523b4ff6ae7c`.

Have fun!
